# ToDoList-Hybrid-IOS-App
This is a Cordova based Hybrid IOS App that points to my ToDo-List WebApp created using ReactJS.

IOS applications can either be created in a native manner by using Swift/Objective-C.

You can also create them by using a mobile application development framework named Cordova by Apache.

This is a hybrid approach which can help to quickly create applications which can be targeted for muliple platforms.

For now, I have created an Application just for IOS platform that points to the WebApp hosted @ https://pandyabhavik2494.github.io/ToDoList-App/

The IOS App is primarly target for Ipad, but can be used on an iphone/ipod too.

The following are the features of the ToDo-List WebApp/ ToDo-List IOS Application:

1. You can add your ToDo tasks and select a priority for them. These tasks will be arranged according to their priorities.
   They will also be color shaded accordingly.

2. You can then choose to remove these tasks or cross them off. You can also uncross them if you crossed them out by mistake.
   

The following are a few snaps of how the WebApp looks like:
